>>RUNNING THE CODE
***Any IDE supporting C++ would be fine for proper execution of program.
***Just run the "main.cpp" file to get desired output in any IDE supporting cpp.

>>INPUT
A text file having graph in it would work just it should be named "input.txt", so that code would run without any changes.

 time of Prim's and Kruskal's functions differently.


****NOTE: All 6 modules and the input text file with name "input.txt" should be placed in the same folder.****
